I was able to complete Lab 7 Messages Pt1
with all parts complete.

The script is able to parse the JSONDATA based on elementid and append it for output as shown in the example. 

I had some difficulties as I wrote jsonDATA instead of jsonData which took some time to debug.

Time to complete 30mins.

I was wondering if a for loop solution could work if we looped around id?
